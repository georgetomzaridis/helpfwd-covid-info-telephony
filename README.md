## Information
HelpFWD is a “Hack Covid 19” initiative spawned during the coronavirus outbreak of early 2020. The idea is to provide a modern web application to the public for those to help people that cannot commute for their basic day to day needs such as food supplies, medicine etc. (https://covid-info.gr / https://helpfwd.com)

## Why telephony?
We want all kind of people to be able to access the platform either online either offline (over-age people).

## How it works?
![alt text](https://github.com/georgetomzaridis/helpfwd-covid19/blob/master/screenshots/helpfwd-infrastucture-pbx.png "HelpFWD Telephony System Structure")

Lets assume that George wants to go outside to get some fresh food but due to COVID-19 pandemic they can't because is over 65 years old and its a little bit risky for him.
1) George calls our 24/7 help request system (+302103005173) and report that need help with supermarket.
2) Automatically the system tries to search the caller location if calls from a landline, from the Public Telephony Catalog (11888.gr Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation S.A).
3) System gets location information about this caller if is available (only landline).
4) The system asks George using text-to-speech technology if this address is correct.
5) George confirms that this address is correct [If is not then George can tell the system the correct address using speech-to-text recognision].
6) Asterisk communicates with Website API Gateway and opens a new request with the above info that George provide (Contact Phone Number, Help Type, Date time, Caller Location).
7) Automatically the system inform George that the request submited successfully and forwards right away the help request to the volunteer groups.
8) If one volunteer group accepts the request, then they can see the sensitive information and contact George to help out!

## System Structure
1. Asterisk PBX: Handling the incoming calls, user input (DMTF/Numbers/Speech), system responses.
2. Telephony Catalog Script: Search and scrap the 11888.gr website to get the require data and convert it to JSON format.
3. API Gateway: Retrieve/Create new help requests, subscribe volunteers to HelpFWD Notification Network (Email/SMS).

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
